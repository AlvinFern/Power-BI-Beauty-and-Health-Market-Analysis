# Power-BI-Beauty-and-Health-Market-Analysis
This is a Power BI project that analyzes the beauty and health market in Australia. The combination of these help us create niche markets like cosmeceuticals, nutricosmetics and nutraceuticals. With the help of an excel dataset, a Power BI dashboard was created to analyze the trends, demand and customer behavior. 

## Key Features
- **Consumer Product Preferences**: The dashboard provides insights into which product types (cosmeceuticals, nutricosmetics, nutraceuticals) are most popular based on customer interest.
- **Confidence and Recommendation Ratings**: Visualizes the average confidence consumers have in these product types and how likely they are to recommend them.
- **Monthly Spending**: Shows spending patterns for different product types, segmented by monthly spending categories.
- **Age Group and Gender Analysis**: Offers insights into the age groups and gender distribution of customers for each product type.
- **State-Wise Analysis**: Displays consumer interest in product types across various Australian states.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis was sourced from an **Excel dataset** containing information on:
- **Customer Preferences**: Information on consumer confidence, recommendation ratings, and product preferences.
- **Spending Behavior**: Data on how much consumers spend on different types of health and beauty products.
- **Demographic Information**: Data on customer demographics including age, gender, and state of residence.

## Key Insights
1. **Nutraceuticals are the Most Popular**: A significant number of consumers show a preference for nutraceuticals compared to cosmeceuticals and nutricosmetics.
2. **Higher Confidence in Cosmeceuticals**: Consumers tend to have the highest confidence in cosmeceuticals, with a higher recommendation rating than the other product types.
3. **Spending Patterns**: Most consumers spend between $50-$100 on nutraceuticals, whereas spending on cosmeceuticals is generally lower.
4. **Age Group Distribution**: The majority of respondents are under the age of 40, with 90 individuals being under 30, indicating that younger customers are driving demand for these products.
5. **State Interest**: Nutraceuticals see the highest demand in **New South Wales**, while cosmeceuticals are less popular in comparison across all states.

## Power BI Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard enables users to:
